<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<h2>About Me:</h2>
<p>Hello! Thank you for coming to my site. 
My name is Sydney Vach, I am from Winter Springs, FL, a town outside Orlando. 
Growing up, I was inspired to pursue a career in STEM after seeing my first 
shuttle launch, and deciding one day that will be me. </p>

<p>I am currently a senior studying Astrophysics and Earth and Planetary 
Science with a secondary in Physics at Harvard College in Cambridge, MA. 
My research interests lie in the intersection between Planetary Science and 
Exoplanets, and how we can use this overlap to better understand planetary 
formation, evolution, and dynamics, as well as our hunt for habitable planets.</p> 

<p>Additionally, my passions lie in education equality, and STEM education. 
I am also an avid reader, mainly Fantasy, as I find it exciting to be able to 
escape into a world of mystery and magic.</p>

<p>I am seeking admission into a Ph.D. program beginning Fall 2022.</p>
